Software
	Because this project is specified around the goal of establishing a Collaborative Environment in an official Conference 
	Center grid. To access the Grid alone, you must have an OpenSim Viewer Software downloaded for your use. The Software 
	that we have established at the Discovery Lab for Virtual World use is the Firestorm Viewer, which is accessible using 
	all systems. The following link is a direct link to the Firestorm Viewer download site:
	
â€¢	http://www.firestormviewer.org/downloads/

When downloading the viewer, you must download the viewer for SL and Opensim, not just the SL viewer.
	
Once the Viewer is downloaded, you must set the primary log in grid region to the Conference Center, which uses the 
acceptable URL conference.deep-horizons.net:8002. Creating an account for this grid must also be completed before it is 
accessible. To accomplish this, create an account on the http://conference.deep-horizons.net:8002/wifi with a Username 
being Your First then Last Name, with a unique password that is memorable. Your Account should then be approved once you 
send an email on to tolsonshea@gmail.com, as this is the email for the monitor of account settings.
